# Decision Tree Classifier – Play Prediction

This project demonstrates a Decision Tree Classifier using Python and scikit-learn to predict whether a game will be played based on weather conditions such as Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind.

The dataset contains both categorical and numerical values. Categorical data is converted into numerical form using Label Encoding. The Decision Tree model is trained using the entropy criterion and visualized using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Create dataset
2. Encode categorical features
3. Train Decision Tree Classifier
4. Visualize the decision tree
5. Evaluate model performance
